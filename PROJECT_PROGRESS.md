# Project Progress Documentation

## Initial Setup
1. Created a new Playwright testing project with TypeScript
2. Set up basic project structure with necessary configuration files:
   - `package.json` with test scripts
   - `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
   - `playwright.config.ts` for test configuration
   - `.gitignore` for version control
   - Configuration YAML files for test settings

## Test Configuration
### Playwright Config Details
- Configured to run tests in parallel
- Set up for specific device viewports:
  - Desktop (1920x1080)
  - iPhone 14 Pro (393x852)
  - iPad 10th generation (1180x820)
- Added SSL error bypass with `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true`
- Configured screenshot settings for failures
- Added HTML reporter

### Environment Setup
- Installed Playwright and its dependencies
- Installed necessary browser drivers
- Set up VS Code integration
- Added YAML parser for configuration
- Added axe-playwright for accessibility testing

### Configuration Management
- Created `config/test.config.yaml` for test settings
- Added `config/test.config.yaml.example` as a template
- Implemented configuration utility in `utils/config.ts`
- Secured sensitive data through .gitignore

## Test Cases Created
### NCPS Login and User Type Selection Test
Location: `tests/ncps-login.spec.ts`

Test features:
- Basic authentication handling
- SSL error bypass
- Extended timeouts (30 seconds)
- Debug logging
- Screenshot capture with viewport dimensions
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility testing

Test steps:
1. Navigate to NCPS page with basic auth
2. Wait for page load
3. Verify presence of user type buttons:
   - PET Student
   - CET Student
   - HS Staff
   - Clinical Staff
4. Test responsive layout across different viewports
5. Run accessibility checks using axe-core
6. Capture viewport-specific screenshots

## Current Status
- Project structure and configuration complete
- Initial test cases implemented including:
  - User interface testing
  - Responsive design testing
  - Accessibility testing
- Configuration management system in place
- Version control setup with appropriate exclusions

## Next Steps
1. Verify server accessibility
2. Run tests in headed mode using `npm run test:headed`
3. Analyze results and adjust selectors/timeouts if needed
4. Consider adding more test cases
5. Add more specific accessibility criteria
6. Consider adding different environment configurations

## Notes
- Configuration uses YAML for better readability and maintenance
- Sensitive data protected from version control
- Test runs on multiple viewport sizes
- Accessibility testing integrated
- Screenshot names include viewport dimensions

## Commands to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui

# View test report
npm run report
```
